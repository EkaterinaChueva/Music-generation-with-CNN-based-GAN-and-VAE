This is a repository for the final project of Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at the University of Padua, taught by prof. Jacopo Pegoraro in a.y. 2023-2024.

The goal of the project was to implement CNN-based models in Pytorch in order to generate music piano rolls.

As the main resource for GAN architecture we used [MidiNet: A Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for Symbolic-domain Music Generation, by Li-Chia Yang, Szu-Yu Chou, Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10847), the VAE architecture
was done from scratch.

The dataset used for this project is the [MAESTRO MIDI Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro), which was obtained by recording the performances of many pianists with Yamaha Disklaviers at the International e-Piano Competition,
for a total over 200 hours of paired audio and MIDI recordings.
